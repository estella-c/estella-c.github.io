                            <h6><b>Roles: UX/UI, Research, Prototype Development</b></h6>
                            <br>
                            <b>Problem</b>: We developed redesigns of Vanguard's Digital Advisor investing dashboard, in collaboration with Lead User Experience Researcher Mr. Steve Schang from Vanguard.
                                The Digital Advisor is an automatic investing service that manages investments for long-term investments, making it ideal for new investors (students and young professionals), 
                                but this introduces many challenges in the development of a dashboard, such as differing levels of financial literacy, navigation, and more.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>What I did</b>: Over the course of three months, I utilized strategies of the UX lifecycle such as user interviews, personas, card-sorting, user flows and more to inform
                                decisions I made when developing my UI kit and wireframes. I also conducted usability tests through UserTesting.com to receive feedback on my final design.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Reflection</b>: From this experience, I implemented industry UX strategies, as well as developed my research and design skills. Balancing client needs and personal preferences
                                also was a challenge:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>Financial Dashboard</i>: Developing an investing dashboard for individuals with limited financial knowledge meant that I had to conduct significant field research
                                        to evaluate which features mattered most. I also included features such as term definitions and pop-ups to help people understand financial concepts.</li>
                                    <li><i>Staying on Schedule</i>: Given our deadline, I had to make sure I was managing my research and development to remain on schedule.</li>
                                    <li><i>Branding</i>: Some decisions, like features of the dashboard, as well as the design (UI Kit), had to be inline with Vanguard's values and established branding. With limited
                                        contact to Vanguard, I also had to do individual research when making these decisions.</li>
                                </ul>

                            portfolio navigation. Essentially, crucial Digital Advisor features were placed on cards then were sorted into pre-set or user-generated categories.

                            <b>Methodology</b>: Based on Vanguard's current brand and UI, I developed the UI kit: The navigation bar, UI colors, fonts, and visualizations were 
                                developed to match Vanguard's brand. Design notes:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Colors</b>: Red based on Vanguard's current logo, however, green became the choice of color for buttons and charts as green is typically 
                                        associated with financial growth and "go". All colors were pulled from existing Vanguard sites and materials. Color palette was limited to
                                        prevent distraction. </li>
                                    <li><b>Font</b>: Based on Vanguard's existing font. Conveys to users that Vanguard is established and reputable in the financial world, but
                                        that Vanguard is welcoming to investors at all financial levels.</li>
                                    <li><b>Navigation bar</b>: Includes redesigned site structure based on card sort data and user feedback. A help button was clearly labeled with
                                        a question mark icon.</li>
                                    <li><b>Visualizations</b>: Users reported preferring visualizations for reading data. A time series graph was used as the primary dashboard
                                        visualization as it is a straightforward representation of capital growth over a period of time.</li>
                                    <li><b>Tables</b>: Clearly summarize and display important financial details to the user.</li>
                                </ul>

                                my high fidelity mockup, I referenced my wireframes and the original Digital Advisor site. Interactive features include: a “regenerate recommendations” 
                                page and a “submit support ticket” flow. Visualizations were developed, the UI dashboard and navigation bar were refined to be less cluttered, and more financial

                <p>Thank you to Vanguard and Mr. Steve Schang for giving us the opportunity to participate in this UX/UI development project.
                    This project allowed to exercise hands-on UX/UI research and design processes to best meet the needs of users. I also
                    wanted to thank all user-testers and team members that participated in my usability tests and projects. Finally, I
                    want to thank my professor, Dr. Laura Ruel, for her guidance throughout this project.
